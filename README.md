# Alert-Server
OBS Script that manages a local web server for use with Twitch API integrations.

# TODO
- This readme
- Deny all connections except those from localhost
- Web server post request handling (and basically all API functionality)

# Some notes
This script uses match statements so python >= 3.10 is required  
  
To use this script, go to the application menu (sometimes seen via pressing ALT) Tools->Scripts  
Press the '+' button, and direct the prompt to this script  
  
As with any standard API integration, it requires you to register your own application and use the respective client ID
